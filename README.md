### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/touch-grass-challenge.git
   cd touch-grass-challenge
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend-vue
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Setup (with VS CODE) 

1. Open the touch-grass-backend with VS Code
2. Go to `src/main/java/com/barsat/touch_grass/TouchGrassApplication.java`
3. Install the Extension Pack for Java from the Extensions Marketplace.
4. Follow the Database Setup instructions below.

### Backend Setup (with Intellij Idea)
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to File â†’ Open.
2. Locate the `touch-grass-backend` project folder and select the `pom.xml` file.
3. When prompted, choose "Open as a Project".
4. Follow the Database Setup instructions below.
5. Press Ctrl + Alt + S to open Settings, navigate to Plugins, and install Lombok from the marketplace.
7. Go to `src/main/java/com/barsat/touch_grass/TouchGrassApplication.java` and run the application. If a notification appears at the bottom right asking to "Enable annotation processing", click on it. Your application should now start.

## Setting up the database
1. Create a database in MySQL. Name your database as you prefer.
2. Open the `touch-grass-backend` in your code editor.
3. Navigate to `resources/application.properties` and update the database credentials with your MySQL Details:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/{your_db_name (the db you just created)} 
spring.datasource.username={your_sql_username}
spring.datasource.password={your_sql_password}
```
* Hibernate will automatically generate the database schema for you.

 Finally go to `src/main/java/com/barsat/touch_grass/TouchGrassApplication.java` and click the run button to start the application.

### Environment Variables
For added security, it is recommended to store your database credentials in environment variables instead of directly placing them in the `application.properties` file. You can create a .env file to manage these variables as per your code editor.
